Python
- Native code: Machine language
- Intermediate language: IL
- Intepreter is required for the Machine to understand the code

VBScript doesn't have complication, it direct translate into native code, while Javascript have so it is slower

Python file extention end with .py
Python is object-oriented programming language

Variables:
- In C+, we need to declare variables type in advance, in Python you dont have to declare type first but just declare the value of variables.
- In Python variables is a reference/pointer to object so it doesn't need declaration of type.

Assignment operation:
- Operators in Python is similar to other languages

String:
- Strings in python are surrounded by single quotation or double quotation (single line)
- If you doing multiple line use triple quotation marks
Ex:
a = """this
is
multiple
line"""

- Strings are also array. 
Ex: If you have string a = "hello"
a[x] will give you the character at (x+1) location since the position count start from 0
a[0] gives 'h'
a[4] gives 'o'
- When using string there is 2 way to go down a line "\r" or "\n"
- The differences is \r is Carriage return and \n is Line feed
- In most cases we use \n to go down a line
